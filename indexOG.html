This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous 
vide.  In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-seeled
in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature
you want the food to be cooked to.  In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter
describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.  

Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.  To reserve
a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time = "20161130" November 30./time> <br>  <br>


Location:<br> Baker's Corner, Seekonk,MA<br>
